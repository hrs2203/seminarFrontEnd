                    Sudden and persistent stresses in the environment threaten the consistent availability and quality of shared natural
                    resources (land, water, air, food) in rural communities over a long period of time, and need assistance because many of
                    these disturbances often exacerbate problems of natural disasters (droughts, floods), crop losses, food insecurity,
                    water availability, and rural poverty. Robust solutions to these problems warrant collaboration and coordination among
                    all stakeholders (from landowner to policymaker) so that the nexus is managed effectively and efficiently. By promoting
                    development and use of innovative participatory decision support and modeling technologies focused on identifying
                    food-energy-water nexus in communities, stakeholders will be empowered to collaborate and self-identify innovative,
                    on-the-ground decisions in all three sectors that work and are resilient to short- and long-term impacts of climate
                    change (e.g., droughts and floods). In this context, using a nexus perspective for resources management in India will
                    provide opportunities for identifying synergies in stakeholders of these governmental programs, as well as identify
                    opportunities for industry collaboration in development of novel technologies that enable combined food-energy-water
                    security in Indian communities. In summary, the need for an action-oriented research that involves stakeholders,
                    scientists, policymakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also advances the use and development of
                    cyberinfrastructure to support participatory approaches is clear. It is necessary that our rural communities in India
                    have access and training to use information and communication technologies as a mode of remote communication between
                    researchers, extension agents and farmers, as well as for coordinating farm-level to watershed-scale decision support to
                    manage uncertainties posed by the future climate.

                    ‘From Knowledge to Action: A Vision for Resilient Rural India’ will be a focusing on the science and practice of
                    managing the interdependencies (nexus) among food, energy and water (FEW) in rural watersheds, and on utilizing the
                    understanding of this nexus for building resilient and sustainable communities constrained by an uncertain future
                    climate. Applications of stakeholder engagement approaches, watershed hydrological models, informatics techniques and
                    methods, and decision support systems to support interdependent food, energy, and water resources in rural watersheds of
                    India will be addressed in this workshop. The various tools utilized in modeling the nexus approach and the pathways to
                    resiliency (in the context of droughts, floods, crop yield loss, economic loss) that could be adopted at a
                    watershed-scale will be discussed. The major objective of this workshop is sensitization of the young researchers and
                    future water professionals by the acclaimed national and international experts for understanding critical issues
                    pertaining to resources management. This workshop will include hands on training on the popular hydrologic model- Soil
                    and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The workshop is organized as a part of the ongoing multi-institutional projects funded
                    by the SPARC initiative of the MHRD, Government of India with the objective to promote international research
                    collaborations and engage a larger community of researchers, practitioners, NGOs, and policy makers to develop a vision
                    for science, technologies, and policy on improving the resilience of vulnerable food, energy, and water systems in rural
                    Indian communities.
