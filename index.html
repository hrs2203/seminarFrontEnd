                    Sudden and persistent stresses in the environment threaten the consistent availability and quality
                    of shared natural
                    resources (land, water, air, food) in rural communities over a long period of time, and need
                    assistance because many of
                    these disturbances often exacerbate problems of natural disasters (droughts, floods), crop losses,
                    food insecurity,
                    water availability, and rural poverty. Robust solutions to these problems warrant collaboration and
                    coordination among
                    all stakeholders (from landowner to policymaker) so that the nexus is managed effectively and
                    efficiently. By promoting
                    development and use of innovative participatory decision support and modeling technologies focused
                    on identifying
                    food-energy-water nexus in communities, stakeholders will be empowered to collaborate and
                    self-identify innovative,
                    on-the-ground decisions in all three sectors that work and are resilient to short- and long-term
                    impacts of climate
                    change (e.g., droughts and floods). In this context, using a nexus perspective for resources
                    management in India will
                    provide opportunities for identifying synergies in stakeholders of these governmental programs, as
                    well as identify
                    opportunities for industry collaboration in development of novel technologies that enable combined
                    food-energy-water
                    security in Indian communities. In summary, the need for an action-oriented research that involves
                    stakeholders,
                    scientists, policymakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also advances the use and
                    development of
                    cyberinfrastructure to support participatory approaches is clear. It is necessary that our rural
                    communities in India
                    have access and training to use information and communication technologies as a mode of remote
                    communication between
                    researchers, extension agents and farmers, as well as for coordinating farm-level to watershed-scale
                    decision support to
                    manage uncertainties posed by the future climate.

                    ‘From Knowledge to Action: A Vision for Resilient Rural India’ will be a focusing on the science and
                    practice of
                    managing the interdependencies (nexus) among food, energy and water (FEW) in rural watersheds, and
                    on utilizing the
                    understanding of this nexus for building resilient and sustainable communities constrained by an
                    uncertain future
                    climate. Applications of stakeholder engagement approaches, watershed hydrological models,
                    informatics techniques and
                    methods, and decision support systems to support interdependent food, energy, and water resources in
                    rural watersheds of
                    India will be addressed in this workshop. The various tools utilized in modeling the nexus approach
                    and the pathways to
                    resiliency (in the context of droughts, floods, crop yield loss, economic loss) that could be
                    adopted at a
                    watershed-scale will be discussed. The major objective of this workshop is sensitization of the
                    young researchers and
                    future water professionals by the acclaimed national and international experts for understanding
                    critical issues
                    pertaining to resources management. This workshop will include hands on training on the popular
                    hydrologic model- Soil
                    and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The workshop is organized as a part of the ongoing
                    multi-institutional projects funded
                    by the SPARC initiative of the MHRD, Government of India with the objective to promote international
                    research
                    collaborations and engage a larger community of researchers, practitioners, NGOs, and policy makers
                    to develop a vision
                    for science, technologies, and policy on improving the resilience of vulnerable food, energy, and
                    water systems in rural
                    Indian communities.
